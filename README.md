Hurricane Island Baseline Phenology
================
by Alex Pesek & Asher Panikian

## Summary
This project is the culmination of the field work done by Alex Pesek on Hurricane Island, a 125 acre island in Penobscot Bay, ME, during the 2023 field season. These data were collected in order to create a strong baseline of phenological information for the island's vegetation. Further research on the island will build upon this body of data in order to track changes in the island's vegetation in the face of climate change. Phenology is the study of timings of the seasonal life stages of organisms. Some examples of phenological happenings include when mammals are birthing, when birds are fledging, or when pollinators are being active. This dataset focuses on plants, whose timings are important within the context of providing resources for other organisms, such as pollen for insects and berries for herbivores. 

## Methods
The methods used for daata collection were bi-weekly and weekly observations of phenophase changes from April to October. These observations noted variables such as counts, percents, and presence/absence. Examples of counts included number of buds, number of flowers, and number of fruits. Examples of percents included percent unfolded leaves, open buds, and ripe fruits. Presnece absence included initial emergence or fallen leaves. All of these data aimed to answer the question, how do Hurricane's plants progress through their phenological phases given the 2023 season? 

## Analysis
We also noted plant location in a leaflet map where the plants are organized by zone in order to analyze the distribution by grouped location. The zones included in the map are the ice pond, meadow garden, main campus, main garden, and south end/high cliffs. Data analysis was primarily based upon two lolipop plot visualizations.
  An animated gif shows multiple lolipop plots displaying the relationship between time and the following phenophases as they occur for individual plants: Leafing out, dispersing, fruiting, flowering, and budding. For the Beach Pea, most of the phenophases occur for similar lenghts of time (about two months each save for the leafing out period which was only recorded during one observation period). In comparison, the Canada Mayflower had very short leafing out, flowering, and budding phases, each lasting less than a month, but its fruiting and dispersing phases each lasted at least three months. Additionally for the Beach Pea the beginnings and endings of the phases overlap with each other broadly whereas the Canada Mayflower's appear to be more stratified. 
  The second lolipop plot includes all species and is faceted by phenophase (from bottom to top; leafing out, flowering, budding, fruiting, dispersal), displaying the beginning and end dates for each phenophase as it occurs for each species. This plot displays that the species with the longest leafing/needling out phase is the Red Spruce which lasted from early June through to the end of field observations in October. The Red Spruce was also the plant which began its leafing out phase the latest. The species with the shotest leafing out phase is the Red Elderberry which occured in late April. The earliest plant to bud was the Canada Mayflower whereas the latest was the Red Spruce. The Starflower had the longest fruiting period, from early June through to the end of observations in October.

## Conclusions

Due to the nature of these data being collected as the beginning of a time series, it is difficult to make in-depth analysis of our findings. As it stands, these data are useful for seeing the individual phenological "fingerprints" of each species observed on Hurricane in 2023. When comparing species against each other we can see that the length and dates of phenophase occurance are rarely equal across species. These data are important to analyze within the context of climate and weather within the season, as well as data colleceted within the broader body of phenological analysis on islands in the Gulf of Maine.
